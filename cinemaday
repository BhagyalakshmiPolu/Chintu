//There is a practice of showing a cinema in the auditorium of a college on a cinema day. A cinema day is a day where the sum of Day(D), Month(M), Year(Y)should be divisible by product of 3 and 4. On that particular day the total number of students in the hostel should be greater than 50 but less than 100. Write a program to find whether the given day is cinema day or not.//
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
int d,m,y,n;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d",&n,&d,&m,&y);
    int a=(d+m+y)%(3*4);
    if(a==0)
    {
        if(n>=50 && n<=100)
        {
            printf("Cinema Day");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("Not a Cinema Day");
        }}
        else
        {
            printf("Not a Cinema Day");
        }
    return 0;
