//A company wishes to provide cab service for their N employees. The employees have distance ranging from 0 to N-1. The company has calculated the total distance from an employeeâ€™s residence to the company, considering the path to be followed by the cab is a straight path. The distance of the side of the company is represented with a negative sign. The distance for the employees who live to the right side of the company is represented with a positive sign. The cab will be allotted a range of distance. The company wishes to find the distance for the employees who live within the particular distance range. Write an algorithm to find the distance for the employees who live within the distance range.//
